# vertx-grpc-java-compiler

This is a custom protobuf compiled for java targetting the Vert.x programming model.

Not much to see for now...

## Build it

gRPC assumes you already have a couple of dependencies on your system:

* Java >=1.7
* `libprotoc` and `libprotobuf`
* a (not to old) Working C++ compiler toolchain

## Fedora build machine dependencies

* gcc
* gcc-c++
* mingw32-gcc
* mingw32-gcc-c++
* mingw64-gcc
* mingw64-gcc-c++
